    "articleBody": "## Math over opinions\n\nFor a long time, people have debated whether \"growth hacking\" is a dirty word. They argue about the ethics of dark patterns, the \"spammy\" nature of aggressive marketing, or the reputation damage caused by tricking users.\n\nBut I’m not interested in the moral argument. I’m interested in the math.\n\nI believe thinking in terms of \"growth hacking\" is fundamentally incorrect. It is a strategic error that prioritizes the illusion of progress over the mechanics of actual business building. It implies that you can cheat the laws of economics or bypass the necessity of product value. You can’t. Eventually, the math always wins.\n\nHere is why the \"hacking\" mindset is flawed, and the framework I use instead to build sustainable, compounding companies.\n\n## The Flaw: Why \"Hacking\" is the Wrong Variable\n\nThe term \"hack\" suggests a shortcut—a clever workaround to bypass a system's limitations without actually fixing the underlying structure. In software engineering, a hack is a temporary fix that you eventually have to pay down as technical debt. In marketing, it’s no different. Marketing debt accumulates just like code debt; eventually, your shortcuts stop working, and you are left with a broken foundation.\n\nWhen you optimize for \"hacks,\" you optimize for three specific failures:\n\n1. You Prioritize Acquisition Over Retention\n\nGrowth hackers are obsessed with the top of the funnel. How do we get 10,000 signups today? How do we go viral? The problem is that acquiring users for a product that doesn't retain them isn't growth; it’s cash incineration.\n\nIf you hack your way to 100,000 users but have a 90% churn rate because the product value isn't there, you haven't built a business. You've built a turnstile. You are essentially paying to rent users who have no intention of staying, inflating your acquisition numbers while destroying your unit economics. Real growth only happens when new cohorts stack on top of old ones, not when they replace them.\n\n2. You Optimize for Vanity Metrics\n\nHacks are usually designed to spike a specific number: clicks, views, downloads, or signups. These are often vanity metrics. They make the dashboard look green and keep stakeholders happy in the short term, but they rarely correlate to revenue or Lifetime Value (LTV).\n\nA \"hack\" might trick users into clicking a misleading button, but it cannot trick them into finding value in the product. When you optimize for the click rather than the value, you confuse activity with achievement. You might drive traffic, but if that traffic doesn't convert to paying, loyal customers, you are simply accelerating the rate at which you burn through your total addressable market.\n\n3. Hacks Have a Half-Life\n\nA marketing \"trick\" (like an untapped SEO loophole, a bot-driven social strategy, or a viral dark pattern) has diminishing returns. These tactics function on novelty or system exploitation. Once the platform patches the loophole, the algorithm changes, or the audience fatigues, the growth stops dead.\n\nIf your growth depends on hacks, you are on a hamster wheel, constantly searching for the next trick just to maintain the status quo. You are building on rented land, at the mercy of platform owners who can shut off your distribution overnight. Sustainable growth cannot rely on ephemeral tactics; it must rely on durable channels.\n\n## The Alternative: Growth Engineering\n\nInstead of \"hacking,\" I use a framework I call Growth Engineering.\n\nWhere hacking looks for shortcuts, engineering looks for systems. It treats growth not as a series of lucky breaks or creative sparks, but as a repeatable, scientific process. It applies the rigor of engineering—measurement, testing, iteration—to the chaos of marketing.\n\n### Here are the three pillars of Growth Engineering:\n\n1. Retention is the Engine\n\nI do not touch acquisition channels until retention is stable. This is the \"Product-Market Fit\" phase. If you pour water into a leaky bucket, you don't need a bigger hose; you need to plug the holes.\n\nThe Metric: Instead of \"Daily Active Users\" (which can be hacked via push notifications or ads), I look at Cohort Retention. Are the users who joined in January still here in April? Does the retention curve flatten out, or does it trend toward zero?\n\nThe Tactic: Focus entirely on the \"Aha!\" moment—the specific action a user takes where they first experience the core value of the product. Identify the friction points preventing users from reaching that moment and systematically remove them. Shorten the \"Time to Value,\" and you don't need to \"hack\" users into staying—they will stay because the product works for them.\n\n2. High-Tempo Testing (The Scientific Method)\n\nGrowth isn't about knowing the answer; it's about finding it faster than everyone else. Instead of throwing spaghetti at the wall or relying on \"best practices,\" we run controlled experiments.\n\nHypothesis: \"If we remove the credit card requirement from the trial, signups will increase by 20% without significantly impacting lead quality or downstream conversion.\"\n\nExecution: A/B test the change on a statistically significant segment of traffic.\n\nAnalysis: Did it work? If yes, roll it out and bank the win. If no, learn why it failed. Was the hypothesis wrong? Was the execution poor?\n\nThe Loop: The goal is to increase the velocity of these experiments. A team running 10 experiments a week will outgrow a team running 1 experiment a month, simply by mathematical probability. Even \"failed\" experiments provide data that informs the next success.\n\n3. Loops > Funnels\n\nThe old model is a linear funnel: Pour money in top -> get customers out bottom. This is expensive and linear; to double growth, you have to double spend. The new model is a loop: One customer brings in another. This creates compounding growth, where your acquisition cost decreases as your scale increases.\n\nViral Loops: Dropbox didn't \"hack\" growth; they engineered a viral loop where users got more storage for referring friends. It was built into the product utility, not tacked on as a marketing campaign. The incentive aligned perfectly with the user's need.\n\nContent Loops: User-generated content (like on TripAdvisor, Pinterest, or Reddit) creates unique SEO pages. These pages rank in search engines, bringing in new users, who then create more content, generating more pages. The product grows itself.\n\n## In Short\n\n\"Growth Hacking\" implies you are smarter than the market—that you can outwit the system. \"Growth Engineering\" implies you are listening to the market—that you are building systems to serve it better.\n\nHacking is a sugar rush; engineering is nutrition. Stop looking for the silver bullet. Build the machine.",

        <h1 class="page-title">Why "Growth Hacking" as incorrect (And What I Use Instead)</h1>
        <p class="excerpt">Growth isn't about finding a silver bullet or a clever Instagram caption. It's about system architecture. I break down why "Funnels" are expensive traps and how I design "Growth Loops"—self-reinforcing systems where every user you acquire automatically generates the next one.</p>
        
        <article class="content">
<h2>Math over opinions</h2><p>For a long time, people have debated whether "growth hacking" is a dirty word. They argue about the ethics of dark patterns, the "spammy" nature of aggressive marketing, or the reputation damage caused by tricking users.</p><p>But I’m not interested in the moral argument. I’m interested in the math.</p><p>I believe thinking in terms of "growth hacking" is fundamentally incorrect. It is a strategic error that prioritizes the illusion of progress over the mechanics of actual business building. It implies that you can cheat the laws of economics or bypass the necessity of product value. You can’t. Eventually, the math always wins.</p><p>Here is why the "hacking" mindset is flawed, and the framework I use instead to build sustainable, compounding companies.</p><h2>The Flaw: Why "Hacking" is the Wrong Variable</h2><p>The term "hack" suggests a shortcut—a clever workaround to bypass a system's limitations without actually fixing the underlying structure. In software engineering, a hack is a temporary fix that you eventually have to pay down as technical debt. In marketing, it’s no different. Marketing debt accumulates just like code debt; eventually, your shortcuts stop working, and you are left with a broken foundation.</p><p>When you optimize for "hacks," you optimize for three specific failures:<br><ul><li>You Prioritize Acquisition Over Retention</li></ul></p><p>Growth hackers are obsessed with the top of the funnel. How do we get 10,000 signups today? How do we go viral? The problem is that acquiring users for a product that doesn't retain them isn't growth; it’s cash incineration.</p><p>If you hack your way to 100,000 users but have a 90% churn rate because the product value isn't there, you haven't built a business. You've built a turnstile. You are essentially paying to rent users who have no intention of staying, inflating your acquisition numbers while destroying your unit economics. Real growth only happens when new cohorts stack on top of old ones, not when they replace them.<br><ul><li>You Optimize for Vanity Metrics</li></ul></p><p>Hacks are usually designed to spike a specific number: clicks, views, downloads, or signups. These are often vanity metrics. They make the dashboard look green and keep stakeholders happy in the short term, but they rarely correlate to revenue or Lifetime Value (LTV).</p><p>A "hack" might trick users into clicking a misleading button, but it cannot trick them into finding value in the product. When you optimize for the click rather than the value, you confuse activity with achievement. You might drive traffic, but if that traffic doesn't convert to paying, loyal customers, you are simply accelerating the rate at which you burn through your total addressable market.<br><ul><li>Hacks Have a Half-Life</li></ul></p><p>A marketing "trick" (like an untapped SEO loophole, a bot-driven social strategy, or a viral dark pattern) has diminishing returns. These tactics function on novelty or system exploitation. Once the platform patches the loophole, the algorithm changes, or the audience fatigues, the growth stops dead.</p><p>If your growth depends on hacks, you are on a hamster wheel, constantly searching for the next trick just to maintain the status quo. You are building on rented land, at the mercy of platform owners who can shut off your distribution overnight. Sustainable growth cannot rely on ephemeral tactics; it must rely on durable channels.</p><h2>The Alternative: Growth Engineering</h2><p>Instead of "hacking," I use a framework I call Growth Engineering.</p><p>Where hacking looks for shortcuts, engineering looks for systems. It treats growth not as a series of lucky breaks or creative sparks, but as a repeatable, scientific process. It applies the rigor of engineering—measurement, testing, iteration—to the chaos of marketing.</p><h3>Here are the three pillars of Growth Engineering:</h3><br><ul><li>Retention is the Engine</li></ul></p><p>I do not touch acquisition channels until retention is stable. This is the "Product-Market Fit" phase. If you pour water into a leaky bucket, you don't need a bigger hose; you need to plug the holes.</p><p>The Metric: Instead of "Daily Active Users" (which can be hacked via push notifications or ads), I look at Cohort Retention. Are the users who joined in January still here in April? Does the retention curve flatten out, or does it trend toward zero?</p><p>The Tactic: Focus entirely on the "Aha!" moment—the specific action a user takes where they first experience the core value of the product. Identify the friction points preventing users from reaching that moment and systematically remove them. Shorten the "Time to Value," and you don't need to "hack" users into staying—they will stay because the product works for them.<br><ul><li>High-Tempo Testing (The Scientific Method)</li></ul></p><p>Growth isn't about knowing the answer; it's about finding it faster than everyone else. Instead of throwing spaghetti at the wall or relying on "best practices," we run controlled experiments.</p><p>Hypothesis: "If we remove the credit card requirement from the trial, signups will increase by 20% without significantly impacting lead quality or downstream conversion."</p><p>Execution: A/B test the change on a statistically significant segment of traffic.</p><p>Analysis: Did it work? If yes, roll it out and bank the win. If no, learn why it failed. Was the hypothesis wrong? Was the execution poor?</p><p>The Loop: The goal is to increase the velocity of these experiments. A team running 10 experiments a week will outgrow a team running 1 experiment a month, simply by mathematical probability. Even "failed" experiments provide data that informs the next success.<br><ul><li>Loops &gt; Funnels</li></ul></p><p>The old model is a linear funnel: Pour money in top -&gt; get customers out bottom. This is expensive and linear; to double growth, you have to double spend. The new model is a loop: One customer brings in another. This creates compounding growth, where your acquisition cost decreases as your scale increases.</p><p>Viral Loops: Dropbox didn't "hack" growth; they engineered a viral loop where users got more storage for referring friends. It was built into the product utility, not tacked on as a marketing campaign. The incentive aligned perfectly with the user's need.</p><p>Content Loops: User-generated content (like on TripAdvisor, Pinterest, or Reddit) creates unique SEO pages. These pages rank in search engines, bringing in new users, who then create more content, generating more pages. The product grows itself.</p><h2>In Short</h2><p>"Growth Hacking" implies you are smarter than the market—that you can outwit the system. "Growth Engineering" implies you are listening to the market—that you are building systems to serve it better.</p><p>Hacking is a sugar rush; engineering is nutrition. Stop looking for the silver bullet. Build the machine.</p>
