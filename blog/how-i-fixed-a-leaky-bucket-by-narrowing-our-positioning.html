    "articleBody": "There is a paradox in growth marketing that is painful for most founders to accept: **To get bigger, you must first get smaller.**\n\nWhen founders pitch me their product, I often ask a simple question: *\"Who is this for?\"* The most dangerous answer I hear is: *\"Everyone.\"* *\"It's for small businesses, and freelancers, and enterprises, and students... it's just a better way to work!\"*\n\nIf you are selling to everyone, you are selling to no one.\n\nThis is not a marketing problem; this is a **Positioning** problem. Positioning is not about what your product *does* features-wise; it is about the *context* in which your product is perceived. It is the mental frame you force your customer to view you through.\n\nI recently worked with a SaaS company that was stuck. They had a great product but a \"leaky bucket\"—lots of traffic, terrible conversion, and high churn. Here is the story of how we fixed the business by narrowing our focus and alienating 80% of our potential market.\n\n### The Generalist Trap (Boiling the Ocean)\n\nThe company had built a \"Project Management Tool.\" The headline on the site was generic: *\"Manage your projects simply.\"* The imagery was stock photos of diverse teams smiling at whiteboards.\n\nThe problem? They were trying to compete with Asana, Monday, Trello, ClickUp, and Notion all at once. They were a tiny dinghy trying to fight a naval war against aircraft carriers.\n\nWhen a visitor landed on the site, their immediate thought was: *\"Why should I use this over Asana, which I already know and trust?\"* The generic copy didn't give them an answer. Because the product tried to satisfy the construction manager, the software developer, and the wedding planner simultaneously, it ended up satisfying none of them deeply. It was \"vanilla\" software—functional, but flavorless.\n\n### The Analysis: Who actually loves us?\n\nTo fix this, we stopped looking at who we *wanted* to be and started looking at who we *actually* were. We dove into the data to find our \"Super Users.\"\n\nWe filtered our user base for accounts with:\n\n1.  **High Retention:** Logged in daily for 6+ months.\n    \n2.  **Net Negative Churn:** Expanded their seat count over time.\n    \n3.  **Low Support Burden:** Didn't ask basic questions.\n    \n\nWe found a startling pattern. Our best users weren't \"generic project managers.\" They weren't software dev teams (who preferred Jira) or sales teams (who preferred Salesforce). They were overwhelmingly **Marketing Agencies** and **Creative Studios**.\n\n**Why?** We interviewed ten of them to find out. It turned out the tool had a specific feature—a visual \"Client Approval\" flow—that allowed external guests to comment directly on images and PDFs without logging in.\n\nFor a software developer, this feature was useless. But for a Creative Director at an ad agency, this feature was a lifesaver. It solved their biggest headache: the \"Email Hell\" of getting client feedback on a design.\n\n### The Pivot: The April Dunford Test\n\nWe applied the framework from April Dunford (author of *Obviously Awesome*). We asked the critical question: *\"If our product didn't exist, what would these specific customers use?\"*\n\n*   **For the Software Team:** They would use Jira. (We lose this fight).\n    \n*   **For the Agency:** They wouldn't use Asana (too rigid). They would use **email threads, messy Google Drive folders, and long meetings.**\n    \n\nWe realized our true competitor wasn't \"Project Management Software.\" Our competitor was \"Administrative Chaos.\"\n\n### The Execution: Niche Down to Scale Up\n\nWe made the scary decision to pivot the entire brand. We rewrote everything to speak only to agencies.\n\n*   **Old Headline:** \"Manage your projects simply.\"\n    \n*   **New Headline:** \"The Project Management Platform Built for Creative Agencies.\"\n    \n*   **Old Subhead:** \"Task lists, calendars, and file sharing for teams.\"\n    \n*   **New Subhead:** \"Stop chasing client approvals. Streamline your creative review process and get paid faster.\"\n    \n*   **Old Imagery:** Generic office workers.\n    \n*   **New Imagery:** Screenshots of video storyboards, design proofs, and client sign-off sheets.\n    \n\n**The Product Roadmap also changed.** We stopped building \"Gantt Charts\" (which construction managers wanted) and started building \"Version Control for Video\" (which agencies craved). We doubled down on our strength rather than fixing our weaknesses.\n\n### The Result\n\nThe immediate result was terrifying: **We lost 30% of our top-of-funnel traffic.** People looking for \"generic to-do lists\" landed on our site, realized it wasn't for them, and bounced. **Good.**\n\nThose people were never going to buy, or if they did, they would have churned in month two. They were \"noise.\"\n\nHowever, look at what happened to the \"signal\":\n\n*   **Conversion Rate increased by 40%.** When an Agency Owner landed on the page, they felt like we had read their diary. They didn't compare us to Asana; they compared us to their painful reality.\n    \n*   **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) dropped.** We stopped bidding on expensive keywords like \"Project Management\" and started bidding on cheap, high-intent keywords like \"Creative Proofing Software.\"\n    \n*   **Churn dropped by half.** Because we attracted the *right* customers, they stayed. The product fit their workflow like a glove.\n    \n\n### The Takeaway\n\nPositioning is an exercise in sacrifice. You have to be willing to say \"No\" to the wrong revenue to say \"Yes\" to the right revenue.\n\nFounders fear niching down because it feels like shrinking the Total Addressable Market (TAM). But a small slice of a market that loves you is infinitely more valuable than a huge market that is indifferent to you.\n\nDon't build a tool for \"everyone.\" Build a tool for *someone*. When that \"someone\" feels seen, understood, and championed, they don't just buy your product; they evangelize it.",

        <p class="excerpt">Most startups fail because they try to be everything to everyone. I share the story of how we used the "April Dunford Test" to pivot from a generic tool to a niche solution, resulting in a 40% lift in conversion despite lower total traffic.</p>
        
        <article class="content">
<p>There is a paradox in growth marketing that is painful for most founders to accept: <strong>To get bigger, you must first get smaller.</strong></p>
<p>When founders pitch me their product, I often ask a simple question: <em>&quot;Who is this for?&quot;</em> The most dangerous answer I hear is: <em>&quot;Everyone.&quot;</em> <em>&quot;It&#39;s for small businesses, and freelancers, and enterprises, and students... it&#39;s just a better way to work!&quot;</em></p>
<p>If you are selling to everyone, you are selling to no one.</p>
<p>This is not a marketing problem; this is a <strong>Positioning</strong> problem. Positioning is not about what your product <em>does</em> features-wise; it is about the <em>context</em> in which your product is perceived. It is the mental frame you force your customer to view you through.</p>
<p>I recently worked with a SaaS company that was stuck. They had a great product but a &quot;leaky bucket&quot;—lots of traffic, terrible conversion, and high churn. Here is the story of how we fixed the business by narrowing our focus and alienating 80% of our potential market.</p>
<h3>The Generalist Trap (Boiling the Ocean)</h3>
<p>The company had built a &quot;Project Management Tool.&quot; The headline on the site was generic: <em>&quot;Manage your projects simply.&quot;</em> The imagery was stock photos of diverse teams smiling at whiteboards.</p>
<p>The problem? They were trying to compete with Asana, Monday, Trello, ClickUp, and Notion all at once. They were a tiny dinghy trying to fight a naval war against aircraft carriers.</p>
<p>When a visitor landed on the site, their immediate thought was: <em>&quot;Why should I use this over Asana, which I already know and trust?&quot;</em> The generic copy didn&#39;t give them an answer. Because the product tried to satisfy the construction manager, the software developer, and the wedding planner simultaneously, it ended up satisfying none of them deeply. It was &quot;vanilla&quot; software—functional, but flavorless.</p>
<h3>The Analysis: Who actually loves us?</h3>
<p>To fix this, we stopped looking at who we <em>wanted</em> to be and started looking at who we <em>actually</em> were. We dove into the data to find our &quot;Super Users.&quot;</p>
<p>We filtered our user base for accounts with:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>High Retention:</strong> Logged in daily for 6+ months.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Net Negative Churn:</strong> Expanded their seat count over time.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Low Support Burden:</strong> Didn&#39;t ask basic questions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We found a startling pattern. Our best users weren&#39;t &quot;generic project managers.&quot; They weren&#39;t software dev teams (who preferred Jira) or sales teams (who preferred Salesforce). They were overwhelmingly <strong>Marketing Agencies</strong> and <strong>Creative Studios</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong> We interviewed ten of them to find out. It turned out the tool had a specific feature—a visual &quot;Client Approval&quot; flow—that allowed external guests to comment directly on images and PDFs without logging in.</p>
<p>For a software developer, this feature was useless. But for a Creative Director at an ad agency, this feature was a lifesaver. It solved their biggest headache: the &quot;Email Hell&quot; of getting client feedback on a design.</p>
<h3>The Pivot: The April Dunford Test</h3>
<p>We applied the framework from April Dunford (author of <em>Obviously Awesome</em>). We asked the critical question: <em>&quot;If our product didn&#39;t exist, what would these specific customers use?&quot;</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>For the Software Team:</strong> They would use Jira. (We lose this fight).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>For the Agency:</strong> They wouldn&#39;t use Asana (too rigid). They would use <strong>email threads, messy Google Drive folders, and long meetings.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We realized our true competitor wasn&#39;t &quot;Project Management Software.&quot; Our competitor was &quot;Administrative Chaos.&quot;</p>
<h3>The Execution: Niche Down to Scale Up</h3>
<p>We made the scary decision to pivot the entire brand. We rewrote everything to speak only to agencies.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Old Headline:</strong> &quot;Manage your projects simply.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>New Headline:</strong> &quot;The Project Management Platform Built for Creative Agencies.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Old Subhead:</strong> &quot;Task lists, calendars, and file sharing for teams.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>New Subhead:</strong> &quot;Stop chasing client approvals. Streamline your creative review process and get paid faster.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Old Imagery:</strong> Generic office workers.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>New Imagery:</strong> Screenshots of video storyboards, design proofs, and client sign-off sheets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Product Roadmap also changed.</strong> We stopped building &quot;Gantt Charts&quot; (which construction managers wanted) and started building &quot;Version Control for Video&quot; (which agencies craved). We doubled down on our strength rather than fixing our weaknesses.</p>
<h3>The Result</h3>
<p>The immediate result was terrifying: <strong>We lost 30% of our top-of-funnel traffic.</strong> People looking for &quot;generic to-do lists&quot; landed on our site, realized it wasn&#39;t for them, and bounced. <strong>Good.</strong></p>
<p>Those people were never going to buy, or if they did, they would have churned in month two. They were &quot;noise.&quot;</p>
<p>However, look at what happened to the &quot;signal&quot;:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Conversion Rate increased by 40%.</strong> When an Agency Owner landed on the page, they felt like we had read their diary. They didn&#39;t compare us to Asana; they compared us to their painful reality.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) dropped.</strong> We stopped bidding on expensive keywords like &quot;Project Management&quot; and started bidding on cheap, high-intent keywords like &quot;Creative Proofing Software.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Churn dropped by half.</strong> Because we attracted the <em>right</em> customers, they stayed. The product fit their workflow like a glove.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Takeaway</h3>
<p>Positioning is an exercise in sacrifice. You have to be willing to say &quot;No&quot; to the wrong revenue to say &quot;Yes&quot; to the right revenue.</p>
<p>Founders fear niching down because it feels like shrinking the Total Addressable Market (TAM). But a small slice of a market that loves you is infinitely more valuable than a huge market that is indifferent to you.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t build a tool for &quot;everyone.&quot; Build a tool for <em>someone</em>. When that &quot;someone&quot; feels seen, understood, and championed, they don&#39;t just buy your product; they evangelize it.</p>
