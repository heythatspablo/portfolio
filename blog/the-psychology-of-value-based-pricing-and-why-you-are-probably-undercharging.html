    "description": "Pricing is the most powerful lever in your business, yet most founders treat it as an afterthought. I break down why \"Cost-Plus\" pricing is a trap and explain how to use the \"Van Westendorp\" method to scientifically find the maximum price your customers are willing to pay.",
    "articleBody": "If I asked you right now how you determined the current price of your product, what would you say?\n\nIf you are like 90% of the founders I meet, you would likely give me one of two answers:\n\n1.  *\"I looked at my biggest competitor, saw they charge $50, and decided to charge $45 to undercut them.\"*\n    \n2.  *\"I calculated my server costs, my time, and my overhead, and added a 20% healthy margin.\"*\n    \n\nBoth of these are fundamental mistakes. They are examples of **Cost-Based Pricing**. They focus entirely on *you*—your internal costs, your competitors, and your insecurities. They ignore the most important variable in the equation: the customer.\n\nThe most profitable companies in the world—from Salesforce to Louis Vuitton—use **Value-Based Pricing**. They do not care what the product costs to make; they care about the value the customer extracts from it.\n\nI believe pricing is the single most undervalued asset in your business strategy. According to a study by the Harvard Business Review, a 1% improvement in price optimization results in an average profit increase of **11.1%**.\n\nHere is why you are likely undercharging, and how to fix it scientifically.\n\n### The Problem with \"Cheaper\" (The Race to the Bottom)\n\nMany founders operate under a false assumption: *\"If I am cheaper, I will get more customers.\"* They fear that raising prices will act as a friction point that kills growth.\n\nThe reality is often the opposite. In B2B software and high-end services, being the cheapest option is often a death sentence.\n\n**1\\. Price is a Signal of Quality** Price is not just a number; it is a piece of communication. If you sell enterprise software for $19/month, you are signaling to the Enterprise CTO that your tool is a toy. You are signaling \"risk.\" You are implying that your security is lax, your support is non-existent, and you might run out of money next year. By raising the price to $500/month, you signal \"robustness,\" \"security,\" and \"longevity.\" You turn your price from a liability into an asset.\n\n**2\\. The \"Bad Customer\" Paradox** Low prices attract the wrong kind of volume. They act as a magnet for price-sensitive, high-maintenance customers.\n\n*   **The $19 Customer:** They are spending their own personal money. They are emotional about the purchase. They complain about missing features, churn quickly if they don't see immediate results, and demand hours of support.\n    \n*   **The $500 Customer:** They are spending a corporate budget. They are rational. They pay upfront annually, read the documentation, integrate deeply, and stay for years. They don't want a refund; they want a solution.\n    \n\nRaising prices acts as a filter. It repels the tourists and attracts the professionals.\n\n### The Tool: The Van Westendorp Meter\n\nYou don't have to guess what your price should be, and you shouldn't rely on \"gut feeling.\" You can measure willingness-to-pay using the **Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter**.\n\nIt is a survey technique where you ask your existing or potential customers four specific questions:\n\n1.  **Too Cheap:** At what price would you consider the product so cheap that you would question its quality? (i.e., \"It must be a scam or buggy at this price.\")\n    \n2.  **Bargain:** At what price would you consider the product to be a great buy?\n    \n3.  **Expensive:** At what price would you consider the product expensive, but you would still consider buying it?\n    \n4.  **Too Expensive:** At what price would you consider the product so expensive that you would not consider buying it?\n    \n\nWhen you collect 50+ responses and plot them on a line graph, you get a clear \"Acceptable Price Range.\"\n\n*   The intersection of \"Too Cheap\" and \"Expensive\" is your **Point of Marginal Cheapness**. Go lower than this, and you lose sales because people don't trust you.\n    \n*   The intersection of \"Too Expensive\" and \"Bargain\" is your **Point of Marginal Expensiveness**. Go higher than this, and the friction outweighs the value.\n    \n\nMost founders discover their current price is actually sitting at the \"Too Cheap\" level.\n\n### Implementing the \"Raise\"\n\nOnce you realize you need to double your prices, the fear sets in. How do you execute this without causing a revolt?\n\n**1\\. Grandfathering (The Loyalty Lock)** Never shock your existing loyal users with a sudden hike. It breaks trust. Instead, use the price increase as a retention mechanism. When I raise prices, I send an email: *\"We are raising prices for new users next month to reflect the new value we've added. However, as a thank you for backing us early, we are keeping you on your current legacy plan forever.\"* This turns your price increase into a gift. Your users now hold a valuable asset (a grandfathered cheap plan) that they lose if they ever churn. Retention skyrockets.\n\n**2\\. The Anchor Price (The Decoy)** Pricing is relative. A $100 bottle of wine looks expensive on a shelf of $20 bottles. But place it next to a $500 bottle, and it suddenly looks like a reasonable, mid-market choice. Always offer a \"Decoy\" tier. If you want to sell a $100 plan, place it next to a $500 \"Enterprise\" plan. The $500 plan exists primarily to make the $100 plan look affordable by comparison. This is **Price Anchoring**.\n\n**3\\. Charge for the Value Metric** Don't just charge \"per user\" blindly. That penalizes collaboration (you don't want customers hesitating to invite their team). Charge by the metric that aligns with their success.\n\n*   **Slack** charges per active user. (Good).\n    \n*   **Intercom** charges per active customer reached. (Good).\n    \n*   **AWS** charges per compute used. (Good).\n    \n\nIf your pricing is aligned with value, your revenue grows automatically as your customer grows, without you ever having to ask for a new contract. This is \"Expansion Revenue,\" the holy grail of SaaS.\n\n### The Takeaway\n\nYour price is not a reflection of your costs. It is a reflection of the value you capture.\n\nThe customer does not care about your rent, your server bills, or your coffee budget. They care about *their* problem. If your product solves a painful, expensive $100,000 problem for them, charging $5,000 is a bargain, even if it only costs you $5 to host.\n\nStop apologizing for your price. If your product truly works, your price should hurt a little. That sting is how the customer knows it’s working.",

        <h1 class="page-title">The Psychology of "Value-Based Pricing" and Why You Are Probably Undercharging</h1>
        <p class="excerpt">Pricing is the most powerful lever in your business, yet most founders treat it as an afterthought. I break down why "Cost-Plus" pricing is a trap and explain how to use the "Van Westendorp" method to scientifically find the maximum price your customers are willing to pay.</p>
        
        <article class="content">
<p>If I asked you right now how you determined the current price of your product, what would you say?</p>
<p>If you are like 90% of the founders I meet, you would likely give me one of two answers:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><em>&quot;I looked at my biggest competitor, saw they charge $50, and decided to charge $45 to undercut them.&quot;</em></p>
</li>
<li><p><em>&quot;I calculated my server costs, my time, and my overhead, and added a 20% healthy margin.&quot;</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Both of these are fundamental mistakes. They are examples of <strong>Cost-Based Pricing</strong>. They focus entirely on <em>you</em>—your internal costs, your competitors, and your insecurities. They ignore the most important variable in the equation: the customer.</p>
<p>The most profitable companies in the world—from Salesforce to Louis Vuitton—use <strong>Value-Based Pricing</strong>. They do not care what the product costs to make; they care about the value the customer extracts from it.</p>
<p>I believe pricing is the single most undervalued asset in your business strategy. According to a study by the Harvard Business Review, a 1% improvement in price optimization results in an average profit increase of <strong>11.1%</strong>.</p>
<p>Here is why you are likely undercharging, and how to fix it scientifically.</p>
<h3>The Problem with &quot;Cheaper&quot; (The Race to the Bottom)</h3>
<p>Many founders operate under a false assumption: <em>&quot;If I am cheaper, I will get more customers.&quot;</em> They fear that raising prices will act as a friction point that kills growth.</p>
<p>The reality is often the opposite. In B2B software and high-end services, being the cheapest option is often a death sentence.</p>
<p><strong>1. Price is a Signal of Quality</strong> Price is not just a number; it is a piece of communication. If you sell enterprise software for $19/month, you are signaling to the Enterprise CTO that your tool is a toy. You are signaling &quot;risk.&quot; You are implying that your security is lax, your support is non-existent, and you might run out of money next year. By raising the price to $500/month, you signal &quot;robustness,&quot; &quot;security,&quot; and &quot;longevity.&quot; You turn your price from a liability into an asset.</p>
<p><strong>2. The &quot;Bad Customer&quot; Paradox</strong> Low prices attract the wrong kind of volume. They act as a magnet for price-sensitive, high-maintenance customers.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The $19 Customer:</strong> They are spending their own personal money. They are emotional about the purchase. They complain about missing features, churn quickly if they don&#39;t see immediate results, and demand hours of support.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The $500 Customer:</strong> They are spending a corporate budget. They are rational. They pay upfront annually, read the documentation, integrate deeply, and stay for years. They don&#39;t want a refund; they want a solution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Raising prices acts as a filter. It repels the tourists and attracts the professionals.</p>
<h3>The Tool: The Van Westendorp Meter</h3>
<p>You don&#39;t have to guess what your price should be, and you shouldn&#39;t rely on &quot;gut feeling.&quot; You can measure willingness-to-pay using the <strong>Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter</strong>.</p>
<p>It is a survey technique where you ask your existing or potential customers four specific questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Too Cheap:</strong> At what price would you consider the product so cheap that you would question its quality? (i.e., &quot;It must be a scam or buggy at this price.&quot;)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bargain:</strong> At what price would you consider the product to be a great buy?</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Expensive:</strong> At what price would you consider the product expensive, but you would still consider buying it?</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Too Expensive:</strong> At what price would you consider the product so expensive that you would not consider buying it?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When you collect 50+ responses and plot them on a line graph, you get a clear &quot;Acceptable Price Range.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The intersection of &quot;Too Cheap&quot; and &quot;Expensive&quot; is your <strong>Point of Marginal Cheapness</strong>. Go lower than this, and you lose sales because people don&#39;t trust you.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The intersection of &quot;Too Expensive&quot; and &quot;Bargain&quot; is your <strong>Point of Marginal Expensiveness</strong>. Go higher than this, and the friction outweighs the value.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most founders discover their current price is actually sitting at the &quot;Too Cheap&quot; level.</p>
<h3>Implementing the &quot;Raise&quot;</h3>
<p>Once you realize you need to double your prices, the fear sets in. How do you execute this without causing a revolt?</p>
<p><strong>1. Grandfathering (The Loyalty Lock)</strong> Never shock your existing loyal users with a sudden hike. It breaks trust. Instead, use the price increase as a retention mechanism. When I raise prices, I send an email: <em>&quot;We are raising prices for new users next month to reflect the new value we&#39;ve added. However, as a thank you for backing us early, we are keeping you on your current legacy plan forever.&quot;</em> This turns your price increase into a gift. Your users now hold a valuable asset (a grandfathered cheap plan) that they lose if they ever churn. Retention skyrockets.</p>
<p><strong>2. The Anchor Price (The Decoy)</strong> Pricing is relative. A $100 bottle of wine looks expensive on a shelf of $20 bottles. But place it next to a $500 bottle, and it suddenly looks like a reasonable, mid-market choice. Always offer a &quot;Decoy&quot; tier. If you want to sell a $100 plan, place it next to a $500 &quot;Enterprise&quot; plan. The $500 plan exists primarily to make the $100 plan look affordable by comparison. This is <strong>Price Anchoring</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>3. Charge for the Value Metric</strong> Don&#39;t just charge &quot;per user&quot; blindly. That penalizes collaboration (you don&#39;t want customers hesitating to invite their team). Charge by the metric that aligns with their success.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Slack</strong> charges per active user. (Good).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Intercom</strong> charges per active customer reached. (Good).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>AWS</strong> charges per compute used. (Good).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If your pricing is aligned with value, your revenue grows automatically as your customer grows, without you ever having to ask for a new contract. This is &quot;Expansion Revenue,&quot; the holy grail of SaaS.</p>
<h3>The Takeaway</h3>
<p>Your price is not a reflection of your costs. It is a reflection of the value you capture.</p>
<p>The customer does not care about your rent, your server bills, or your coffee budget. They care about <em>their</em> problem. If your product solves a painful, expensive $100,000 problem for them, charging $5,000 is a bargain, even if it only costs you $5 to host.</p>
<p>Stop apologizing for your price. If your product truly works, your price should hurt a little. That sting is how the customer knows it’s working.</p>
